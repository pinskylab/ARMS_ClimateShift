# ARMS_ClimateShift

Source data and figure scripts for Pinsky et al. 2020 Annual Review of Marine Science 

- data/poloczanska2013NCC/nceas.999.1_depth.xlsx: Depth change data from Poloczanska et al. 2013 Nature Climate Change. Added new Deeper_shallower column to clarify whether and in which direction species shifted, since this was inconsistent among studies. No change includes a change that was not statistically significant based on the dec.test column.

- data/poloczanska2016frontiersmarinescience/table 2_cleaned.xlsx: Fixed two small typos from the original dataset. Has range change data (expansion, contraction, or no change).
